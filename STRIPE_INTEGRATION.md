- `pages/packages.tsx` - Updated to use Stripe payment flow
- `hooks/useMutations.ts` - Added payment intent mutation
- `api/index.js` - Exported PaymentApi
- `lib/envs.ts` - Added Stripe publishable key

## 🔧 Environment Setup

Add the following environment variable to your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Payment Flow
1. User clicks "Purchase" button on a package or subscription
2. `PaymentButton` component triggers `PaymentDialog`
3. `PaymentDialog` calls the server to create a payment intent
4. Stripe `CheckoutForm` handles the secure payment processing
5. On success, the user's credits/subscription is automatically updated

### 2. Server API Integration
The client expects your server to have this endpoint:

```
POST /api/payment/create-intent
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN

{
  "type": "package", // or "subscription"
  "itemId": "67bb03bd7f8dc3893caffee7"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "clientSecret": "pi_3QkXXXXXXXXXXX_secret_YYYYYYYYYYY",
    "amount": 29.99,
    "itemName": "10 Credit Package"
  }
}
```

### 3. Components Usage

#### PaymentButton
```tsx
<PaymentButton
  itemType="package" // or "subscription"
  itemId="package_id_here"
  itemName="10 Credit Package"
  itemPrice={29.99}
  onSuccess={() => {
    // Handle successful payment
    window.location.reload();
  }}
>
  Purchase Package
</PaymentButton>
```

#### PaymentDialog (used internally)
```tsx
<PaymentDialog
  isOpen={isOpen}
  onClose={onClose}
  onSuccess={onSuccess}
  itemType="package"
  itemId="package_id"
  itemName="10 Credit Package"
  itemPrice={29.99}
/>
```

## 🔄 Testing
Use Stripe's test card numbers for development:
- `4242424242424242` - Visa (succeeds)
- `4000000000000002` - Visa (declined)

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Add your Stripe publishable key to environment variables
2. Ensure your server implements the payment intent endpoint
3. Test the payment flow with Stripe test cards
4. Configure webhooks on your server for payment confirmations

The integration is now complete and ready for testing! 🎉
